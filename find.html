//The find() method returns the value of the first element in the array
//that satisfies the provided testing function.
//Otherwise undefined is returned.
//executes the callback function once for each index of the array
//  until it finds one where callback returns a true
//If an element is found meeting callback criteria, find immediately returns the value of that element
//callback is invoked with three arguments 3 the value of the element,
//callback is invoked with three arguments 2 the index of the element,
//callback is invoked with three arguments 3 the Array object being traversed
//If a thisArg parameter is provided to find,
//  it will be used as the this for each invocation of the callback
//find does not mutate the array on which it is called
//The range of elements processed by find is set before the first invocation of callback.
//Elements that are appended to the array after the call to find begins will not be visited by callback.
//If an existing, unvisited element of the array is changed by callback,
//  its value passed to the visiting callback will be the value at the time that find visits that element's index;
//elements that are deleted are still visited
