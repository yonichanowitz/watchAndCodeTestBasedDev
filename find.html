/*question: how to make small requirements that aren't too small, that add onto each other. example of too small===
'loop through array'
'pass element to callback'
or maybe they aren't? maybe i should have a requirement 'selsect individual element'?
but then it would be finding it already, and defeat the purpose of small features!

once i loop with a for() loop, how do i keep the older requirement s working when the next requirement-
 requires that i use the function as the means to make a loop. 
 unless that is incorrect.

when gordon does reduce() he starts with "if initialValue, callback should run array.length times"
which he then tests by  
a) declaring variable of amount of times it ran, set to zero 
b) calling the function with the smallest of arrays, that only includes a number
c) the function xcalls a callback which
d) adds to the value of the variable declared in step 'a'
e) tests the variable (eq) against the number 1 (since the value should have increased if the callback function ran)

how did he know he was supposed to do that?

   ANSWER: by playing with fucntion

to avoid modifying the origional array, i think that i can't use a new variable to asign a result to (to be returned) but rather, 
have several loops and functions within each other that end in return statements. 
this should work, as we only need to return a single value (or object) that satisfi

use debugger, and enter items in scope into console
only have assumptions when it helps you make progress

what gordon did with reduce
1) write them down, do not worry about being organized or exact requirements
2) turn into concrete specific things to implement
3) goes through description and makes every sentence with new information a requirement
4) uses 'if' words as pointers to new requirements
5) copies sentences from the description almost word-for-word, abut rewords them as questions

each test should be independent, and have it's own array that it uses. in short
DON'T USE THE SAME ARRAY FOR EACH TEST
it avoids creating extra, unnecessary work 
don't inovate on things that don't matter, it creates confusion(pokemon array)
the rules can only be broken by people who understand them

Yonaton, think about what Gordon’s saying… Think about the possibility if your test modifies the array, even accidentally?  Then all your tests are based on an array that has changed, or could change based on test results…

what do you expect the result to be?
what code will actually check how it will run?
eq(testCheckingStuff. expectedResult)

variables are missleading
err on the side of being more explicit
focus on clarity, not brevity

how do i frame my mind to do things that will lead to progress?

always have a specific example
